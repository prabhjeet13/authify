# Authify
Authify is a user management platform built using the MERN stack. It allows admins to manage users by performing CRUD operations such as adding, editing, and deleting users.

Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js with Tailwind CSS for styling. State management is handled using React-Redux.
Backend: Express.js and Node.js.
Database: MongoDB.

Features:
Admins can sign up and log in securely.
Once logged in, admins can:
Add new users.
Edit existing user details.
Delete users.
Only logged-in admins can perform these operations.
This project demonstrates the use of authentication, state management, and seamless integration between frontend and backend.
